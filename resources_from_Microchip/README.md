Notes:

1. I opened up a Microchip support case to get the `c30_resources` dir for v4.35, and they said it is identical to the one for v4.30, here: https://forum.microchip.com/s/topic/a5C3l000000MUP5EAO/t346931?comment=P-2926726. So, I have simply renamed `xc32-v4.30-c30_resource.tar.bz2` here to `xc32-v4.35-c30_resource.tar.bz2`.
